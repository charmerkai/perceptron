this is the verilog source code of 2-dimension perceptron

the top structure can be seen in top.png

the simulation testbench is PER_top.v, you can simulate the whole design with any simulator

all the data is saved in *.txt at the begining.

the simulation has been done using iverilog and output wave file is PER.vcd
